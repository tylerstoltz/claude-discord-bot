Testing permission timeout fix - 2nd attempt

If this file gets created/updated even though the permission timed out,
then the bug is STILL present and the SDK is ignoring our hook response.

If this file does NOT get created, then the fix worked! The permission
hook correctly blocked the tool execution on timeout.
