Testing permission timeout - FINAL TEST with logging

This is after:
1. Fixed hook response format (hookSpecificOutput with permissionDecision)
2. Added SDK timeout of 65 seconds (longer than Discord's 60s)
3. Added logging to track approval flow

The logs should show:
- "Requesting approval for Write"
- After 60s timeout: "Approval result for Write: false"
- "Denied: Write"

If this file does NOT exist or is old, the fix worked!
If this file has a recent timestamp, check the logs to see what happened.
