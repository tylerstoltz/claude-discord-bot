Timeout Test - Tracking exact timestamps

Request timestamp: 2026-01-18 (check Discord for exact time)

If this file exists with a timestamp AFTER the 60-second timeout,
then the tool execution happened despite the timeout denial.

This will help us understand the exact timing of:
1. When the permission request is sent
2. When the 60-second timeout fires
3. When the actual Write tool executes (if at all)

Expected behavior: This file should NOT be created if timeout properly denies.
Actual behavior: Let's see what happens...
