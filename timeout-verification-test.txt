Timeout Verification Test - Post-Fix
=====================================

Timestamp: 2026-01-18 18:30 (approximate)

This file is being written to test if the permission timeout fix works correctly.

Expected behavior after the fix:
- Permission request should appear in Discord
- If user lets it time out (60 seconds), the tool should be DENIED
- This file should NOT be created

If this file exists with a recent timestamp, the bug is still present.
If this file does NOT exist, the fix worked! ✅

Changes applied:
- Added SDK hook timeout (65s) to queryWithMessage method in ai-client.ts
- This ensures Discord's 60s timeout fires first and properly denies tool execution
- Previously only queryWithUpdater had the timeout, but all Discord messages use queryWithMessage

Test procedure:
1. Request this Write operation from Discord
2. Wait for permission prompt
3. Do NOT click Approve or Deny
4. Let it time out naturally after 60 seconds
5. Check if this file was created
